    <p>I was born and raised in Queens, NY. Since graduating 
        high school, I've done so many different jobs. I've worked
        in restaurants, sold cars, did mortgages, owned my own business, 
        among many other things. It took a long time, but two years ago I
        graduated from college with a degree in psychology (I should've
        done computer science). I am very excited to start this new adventure
        with coding.
